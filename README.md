# SSAO Demo

This is a simple demo containing an implementation of Screen Space Ambient Occlusion in OpenGL (implementation based on [John Champan's description](http://john-chapman-graphics.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/ssao-tutorial.html)).

It was originally written as a final project for a graphics course.

The code is pretty messy.

## Usage
When run, the program renders the Stanford bunny inside a room, with SSAO turned off.

Press 'a' to enable/disable ambient occlusion.

You can move around and rotate with mouse click-and-drag controls.

Use the up/down arrows keys to increase/decrease depth discontinuity radius.

## Compilation
The program can be built easily with Visual Studio 2010 using the included solution/project files.
